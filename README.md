# Semi_Supervised_Learning
Implementation of Semi-Supervised and Semi-Weakly Supervised Teacher/Student Learning approaches.

## Requirements
Python==3.6.9, albumentations==0.1.8, numpy==1.17.3, opencv==4.2.0, pandas==0.25.2, pillow==6.1.0, torchvision==0.3.0, pytorch==1.1.0

## Best models
The best models for the Teacher and the Student, trained with the Semi-Weakly Supervised approach, are available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HdCrMq5ojhi9fKF23e3viRt0hrVtRbvl?usp=sharing.
The best models for the Teacher and the Student, trained with the Semi-Supervised approach, are available upon the paper publication.

## Scripts organization
The repository includes the scripts for training the models (training_scripts), for testing the models (inference scripts) and for the preprocessing/generation of the csv files (utils).

### Training_scripts
The folder includes two scripts: the one to train the teacher and the one to train the student.
